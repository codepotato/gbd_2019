              The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is one of the most
              comprehensive, epidemiological collaborations worldwide
              describing life expectancy as well as mortality and morbidity burden from major diseases and injuries including risk factors at local,
              regional, national, and global levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data are collected and analysed by a consortium of more than 7,000
              researchers to estimate premature death and disability in 195
              countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present (with the
              latest data up to 2019), allowing for comparisons over time,
              across age groups, and in different parts of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data are refreshed every two years and with each revision, data
              and methodological innovations are fed into models, annual
              estimates are comprised for 360 diseases and injuries and 85 risk
              factors.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this analysis, which serves to present an overall picture of
              burden of disease in West Sussex, we aim to
              describe changes in life expectancy over time as well as explore
              the top causes of death for those living in West Sussex, comparing
              to regional and national estimates where possible. We also aim to
              describe alternative measures of the burden of disease.

            <div class="title give_me_some_space">What you should know</div>
            <p>
              There are a number of caveats and limitations you should consider
              when using these estimates
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data are
                sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at all. As
                a result, you should consider that there is a margin of error
                when interpreting these results as they are simply estimates or
                'best guesses'.
              </li>
              <li>
                Estimates from the GBD do not compare directly to reported
                statistics within England (where these are available) as all
                estimates are constructed using the GBD methodology. Note that
                figures are rounded to the nearest whole number, and percentages
                are rounded to the nearest single decimal point. This is to make
                interpretation of the findings easier to follow but it can mean
                that some values show as zero when they have a value between 0
                and 0.5.
              </li>
              <li>
                A change in rank does not necessarily mean that a metric for a
                cause has got better/worse.
              </li>
              <li>
                The GBD diseases/conditions and risks are split and aggregated
                into hierarchical levels. The cause list is mutually exclusive
                and collectively exhaustive at every level of aggregation;
                causes not individually specified are captured in residual
                categories, such as 'other intestinal infectious diseases'.

              Other ways to measure burden
            </div>
            <p>
              Whilst we explore the leading causes of death in West Sussex, and
              the relative changes in life expectancy, the burden of
              disease can be measured by more than just what kills us and the
              number of people who have died.
            </p>
            <p>
              The figure to the right illustrates the different measures of the burden of ill health over the lifecourse of a typical person.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deaths are well recorded in the majority of developed nations. In England, when a person dies, their death is certified and registered formally with the registry office for the local authority district in which the person lived or the district office in which the hospital is located if they died in hospital. A death should be registered within five days of the death occurring, and upon the issue of a medical certificate detailing the cause or causes of death.<br><br>It is one thing to count the number of people who are deceased and quite another to estimate what the cause of death. In some cases it is clear (for example accidents/injuries) but for others it may be much more complicated (for example among those with multiple long term conditions). Cause-specific deaths (discussed later in this analyses) are estimated using statistical modelling and are adjusted to match the all-cause totals. </li>
              <li>
                Years of life lost (YLLs) are calculated by subtracting the age
                at death from the longest possible life expectancy for a person
                at that age. This is often calculated separately for each sex.
                For example, if the longest life expectancy for males in a given
                country is 75, and a male dies of cancer at 65, this would be 10
                years of life lost due to cancer, if a female dies at the same
                age but the life expectancy for females is 85, this equals 20
                YLLs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Years lived with disability (YLDs) are estimates of the number
                of years lived in less than ideal health. Some conditions such
                as influenza last for only a few days, whereas epilepsy can last
                a lifetime. Disability weights reflecting the severity of each
                condition are developed using a variety of data sources
                including national surveys, the national cancer registration
                system, hospital episode statistics and multiple published
                resarch studies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are the sum of years of
                life lost and years lived with disability. This is the best
                measure to consider the overall impact of a specific cause or
                group of causes on a population.
              </li>
            </ul>
           
              <p>The green section (the DALY) is a useful measure because it also allows the comparison of acute conditions such as stroke or heart attacks with conditions like diabetes or circulatory diseases with conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders which may not ordinarily cause premature death but none the less reduce the quality of someones life.</p>
              <p>DALYs use disability weights (0 = perfect health and 1 = death) which are generated through consultations with clinicians and other experts. This helps to account for those conditions which can be well managed.</p>
              <p>As such, a DALY represents the amount of time in sub-optimal health and our goal in public health is to reduce the DALY values where possible and improve the chances of individuals spending more of their lives in good quality healthy states.</p>

            <div class="title give_me_some_space">Life expectancy</div>
            <p>
              Life expectancy has increased in the last 20 years, from 79 years
              in 1997 to 81.7 years in 2017 (81.3 years to 83.5 years among
              females and from 76.5 years to 79.9 years among males). In the
              last five years, however, overall life expectancy at birth has
              actually gone down (from 82.2 years in 2012).
            </p>
            <p>
              Healthy life expectancy has also increased since 1997 from 68.4
              years overall (69.5 years and 67 years for females and males
              respectively) to 69.9 years in 2017 (70.6 years and 69.1 years for
              females and males respectively). The gain in healthy life
              expectancy has not been as high (in terms of percentage increase
              or actual years) compared to gains in overall life expectancy, and
              similar to overall life expectancy, healthy life expectancy
              estimates have declined since 2012.

              Has the burden of disease changed over time?
            </div>

            <p>
              So far we have looked at ill health for those in West Sussex using
              the 'crude' or unstandardised values, as this gives an idea of the
              scale of the burden of ill health for our population. We know that
              age is a very important determinent of ill health and disability
              and from the section above we can see that conditions affect
              people of different ages.
            </p>

            <p>
              To account for differences in population size and demographics,
              the remaining analyses use standardised estimates which detail the
              number (e.g. deaths) per 100,000 population.
            </p>
            <p>Compare 2009, 2014, and 2019</p>

            <div class="title give_me_some_space">Standardising rates</div>
            <p>
              Looking at crude estimates helps to know what the true impact
              might be for our area (e.g. to anticipate the number of patients a
              service might need to cater for, the number of cases) and this can
              help to plan services.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              You could compare these crude estimates with those in other areas,
              or over time, to see if things are better in some areas or are
              improving over time, although any differences (or similarities) in
              estimates could be at least in part due the underlying differences
              in populations (e.g. areas with fewer or greater numbers of older
              people, or the shear size of the population).
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, area A may have recorded 2,000 deaths and area B
              recorded 1,500 deaths. You might think that area A has a much
              bigger issue of mortality than area B. However, if area A has a
              population of 500,000, the rate of deaths would be 400 deaths per
              100,000 population. If area B has a population of 300,000, then
              the rate of deaths is higher in area B (500 per 100,000
              population).

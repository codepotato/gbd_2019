                The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is one of the most
                comprehensive, epidemiological collaborations worldwide
                describing life expectancy as well as mortality and morbidity
                burden from major diseases and injuries including risk factors
                at local, regional, national, and global levels.

                Data are collected and analysed by a consortium of more than
                7,000 researchers to estimate premature death and disability in
                195 countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present (with
                the latest data up to 2019), allowing for comparisons over time,
                across age groups, and in different parts of the world.

              <p>
                Data are refreshed every two years and with each revision, data
                and methodological innovations are fed into models, annual
                estimates are comprised for 360 diseases and injuries and 85

                In this analysis, which serves to present an overall picture of
                burden of disease in West Sussex, we aim to describe changes in
                life expectancy over time as well as explore the top causes of
                death for those living in West Sussex, comparing to regional and
                national estimates where possible. We also aim to describe

              <p>
                Whilst we explore the leading causes of death in West Sussex,
                and the relative changes in life expectancy, the burden of
                disease can be measured by more than just what kills us and the
                number of people who have died.
              </p>
              <p>
                This figure illustrates the different measures of the burden of
                ill health over the lifecourse of a typical person.
              </p>

                  Deaths are well recorded in the majority of developed nations.
                  In England, when a person dies, their death is certified and
                  registered formally with the registry office for the local
                  authority district in which the person lived or the district
                  office in which the hospital is located if they died in
                  hospital. A death should be registered within five days of the
                  death occurring, and upon the issue of a medical certificate
                  detailing the cause or causes of death.<br /><br />It is one
                  thing to count the number of people who are deceased and quite
                  another to estimate what the cause of death. In some cases it
                  is clear (for example accidents/injuries) but for others it
                  may be much more complicated (for example among those with
                  multiple long term conditions). Cause-specific deaths
                  (discussed later in this analyses) are estimated using
                  statistical modelling and are adjusted to match the all-cause
                  totals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Years of life lost (YLLs) are calculated by subtracting the
                  age at death from the longest possible life expectancy for a
                  person at that age. This is often calculated separately for
                  each sex. For example, if the longest life expectancy for
                  males in a given country is 75, and a male dies of cancer at
                  65, this would be 10 years of life lost due to cancer, if a
                  female dies at the same age but the life expectancy for
                  females is 85, this equals 20 YLLs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Years lived with disability (YLDs) are estimates of the number
                  of years lived in less than ideal health. Some conditions such
                  as influenza last for only a few days, whereas epilepsy can
                  last a lifetime. Disability weights reflecting the severity of
                  each condition are developed using a variety of data sources
                  including national surveys, the national cancer registration
                  system, hospital episode statistics and multiple published
                  resarch studies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are the sum of years of
                  life lost and years lived with disability. This is the best
                  measure to consider the overall impact of a specific cause or
                  group of causes on a population.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The green section (the DALY) is a useful measure because it also
                allows the comparison of acute conditions such as stroke or
                heart attacks with conditions like diabetes or circulatory
                diseases with conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders which
                may not ordinarily cause premature death but none the less
                reduce the quality of someones life.
              </p>
              <p>
                DALYs use disability weights (0 = perfect health and 1 = death)
                which are generated through consultations with clinicians and
                other experts. This helps to account for those conditions which
                can be well managed.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, a DALY represents the amount of time in sub-optimal
                health and our goal in public health is to reduce the DALY
                values where possible and improve the chances of individuals
                spending more of their lives in good quality healthy states.

              <p>
                There are a number of caveats and limitations you should
                consider when using these estimates
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data
                  are sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at
                  all. As a result, you should consider that there is a margin
                  of error when interpreting these results as they are simply
                  estimates or 'best guesses'.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Estimates from the GBD do not compare directly to reported
                  statistics within England (where these are available) as all
                  estimates are constructed using the GBD methodology. Note that
                  figures are rounded to the nearest whole number, and
                  percentages are rounded to the nearest single decimal point.
                  This is to make interpretation of the findings easier to
                  follow but it can mean that some values show as zero when they
                  have a value between 0 and 0.5.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A change in rank does not necessarily mean that a metric for a
                  cause has got better/worse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The GBD diseases/conditions and risks are split and aggregated
                  into hierarchical levels. The cause list is mutually exclusive
                  and collectively exhaustive at every level of aggregation;
                  causes not individually specified are captured in residual
                  categories, such as 'other intestinal infectious diseases'.
                </li>

                This means that whilst females may live longer lives than males,

                Has the burden of disease changed over time?
              </h2>

              <p>
                So far we have looked at ill health for those in West Sussex
                using the 'crude' or unstandardised values, as this gives an
                idea of the scale of the burden of ill health for our
                population. We know that age is a very important determinent of
                ill health and disability and from the section above we can see
                that conditions affect people of different ages.
              </p>

              <p>
                To account for differences in population size and demographics,
                the remaining analyses use standardised estimates which detail
                the number (e.g. deaths) per 100,000 population.
              </p>
              <p>Compare 2009, 2014, and 2019</p>
            </div>

            <div class="title give_me_some_space">Standardising rates</div>
            <p>
              Looking at crude estimates helps to know what the true impact
              might be for our area (e.g. to anticipate the number of patients a
              service might need to cater for, the number of cases) and this can
              help to plan services.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              You could compare these crude estimates with those in other areas,
              or over time, to see if things are better in some areas or are
              improving over time, although any differences (or similarities) in
              estimates could be at least in part due the underlying differences
              in populations (e.g. areas with fewer or greater numbers of older
              people, or the shear size of the population).
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, area A may have recorded 2,000 deaths and area B
              recorded 1,500 deaths. You might think that area A has a much
              bigger issue of mortality than area B. However, if area A has a
              population of 500,000, the rate of deaths would be 400 deaths per
              100,000 population. If area B has a population of 300,000, then
              the rate of deaths is higher in area B (500 per 100,000
              population).
